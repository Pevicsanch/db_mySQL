Creating a database with **MySQL** and conecting with python
______
$~$

In this project we are going to create a database from scratch using **MySQL workbench**. In this case we have created a simple database that simulates a library database.

*The script to generate the database is attached to this **repository***

$~$

Once the database is created, the next thing to do is to connect to the database using **python**.  In this project we show how to do it.

$~$

finally we will make some simple queries, and the results will be passed to pandas dataframes.
